# Objective: 

Create a simple neural network in TensorFlow to classify breast cancer data from the Breast Cancer dataset. Youâ€™ll define the model, train it on labeled data, and evaluate its performance during the training.

Instructions:

Import tensorflow and load the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer. (Including two classes: malignant (0) and benign (1).)
Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation:
Use StratifiedKFold from sklearn.model_selection to perform 5-fold cross-validation.
Define the model architecture:
Input layer: flatten the input data to a 1D vector (since the dataset has 30 features).
Hidden layers: The number of layers and neurons in each layer is up to you. Consider the appropriate activation function. 
Output layer: The output layer should consist of a single neuron (Because it's a binary classification). Consider an appropriate activation function for binary classification. 
Compile the model:
Use Adam as the optimizer.
Use accuracy as the metric.
Train the model:
Train the model on the training data in each fold, using a validation set.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model on the validation set for each fold.
Plot the training and validation accuracy over epochs for each fold.
